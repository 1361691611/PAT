<h1>1046. Shortest Distance (20)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>The task is really simple: given N exits on a highway which forms a simple cycle, you are supposed to tell the shortest distance between any pair of exits.</p>
> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line contains an integer N (in [3, 10<sup>5</sup>]), followed by N integer distances D<sub>1</sub> D<sub>2</sub> ... D<sub>N</sub>, where D<sub>i</sub> is the distance between the i-th and the (i+1)-st exits, and D<sub>N</sub> is between the N-th and the 1st exits.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.  The second line gives a positive integer M (&amp;lt=10<sup>4</sup>), with M lines follow, each contains a pair of exit numbers, provided that the exits are numbered from 1 to N.  It is guaranteed that the total round trip distance is no more than 10<sup>7</sup>.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each test case, print your results in M lines, each contains the shortest distance between the corresponding given pair of exits.</p>
