> The Japanese language is notorious for its sentence ending particles. Personal preference of such particles can be considered as a reflection of the speaker's personality. Such a preference is called "Kuchiguse" and is often exaggerated artistically in Anime and Manga. For example, the artificial sentence ending particle "nyan~" is often used as a stereotype for characters with a cat-like personality:</p>
> <li>Itai nyan~ (It hurts, nyan~)</li>
> <li>Ninjin wa iyada nyan~ (I hate carrots, nyan~)</li>
> <p>
> Now given a few lines spoken by the same character, can you find her Kuchiguse?</p>
> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line is an integer N (2&lt;=N&lt;=100). Following are N file lines of 0~256 (inclusive) characters in length, each representing a character's spoken line. The spoken lines are case sensitive.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
