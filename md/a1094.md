<h1>1094. The Largest Generation (25)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree where all the nodes on the same level belong to the same generation.  Your task is to find the generation with the largest population.</p>
> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  Each case starts with two positive integers N (&amp;lt100) which is the total number of family members in the tree (and hence assume that all the members are numbered from 01 to N), and M (&amp;ltN) which is the number of family members who have children.  Then M lines follow, each contains the information of a family member in the following format:</p>
> <p>
> ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]
> </p>
> <p>where ID is a two-digit number representing a family member, K (&amp;gt0) is the number of his/her children, followed by a sequence of two-digit ID's of his/her children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be 01.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each test case, print in one line the largest population number and the level of the corresponding generation.  It is assumed that such a generation is unique, and the root level is defined to be 1.  </p>
> <b>Sample Input:</b><pre>
> 23 13
> 21 1 23
> 01 4 03 02 04 05
> 03 3 06 07 08
> 06 2 12 13
> 13 1 21
> 08 2 15 16
> 02 2 09 10
> 11 2 19 20
> 17 1 22
> 05 1 11
> 07 1 14
> 09 1 17
> 10 1 18
> </pre>
> <b>Sample Output:</b><pre>
> 9 4
