<h1>1085. Perfect Sequence (25)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>
> Given a sequence of positive integers and another positive integer p.  The sequence is said to be a "perfect sequence" if M &lt;= m * p where M and m are the maximum and minimum numbers in the sequence, respectively.
> </p>
> <p>Now given a sequence and a parameter p, you are supposed to find from the sequence as many numbers as possible to form a perfect subsequence.
> </p>
> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line contains two positive integers N and p, where N (&lt;= 10<sup>5</sup>) is the number of integers in the sequence, and p (&lt;= 10<sup>9</sup>) is the parameter.  In the second line there are N positive integers, each is no greater than 10<sup>9</sup>.</p>

> Output Specification:

> <p>For each test case, print in one line the maximum number of integers that can be chosen to form a perfect subsequence.</p>
