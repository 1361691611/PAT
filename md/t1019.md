<h1>1019. Separate the Animals (35)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>There are some animals in a zoo which can be described as a grid with N rows and M columns.  Your task is to place some obstacles so that no pairs of animals can reach each other.
> </p>
> <p>
> Two animals can <b>reach each other</b> if and only if their cells are <b>4-connected</b>.  For example, in Figure 1, the central blue cell can be reached by the four red cells, and cannot be reached by the other four white cells.

> <p>
> What is more, you must put obstacles in exactly K cells, which are 4-connected and form exactly H holes.  Here a <b>hole</b> is defined as a 4-connected part with finitely many open cells while the zoo is placed in an infinite open grid. For example, there are 2 holes (the green and the yellow areas) in Figure 2.

> Figure 5 is illegal because it contains no hole.

> Figure 6 is also illegal because the obstacles are not 4-connected.

> Given some animals, you are supposed to count the number of different solutions.

> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives four integers: N, M, K, H (2 &lt;= N, M &lt;= 6; 1 &lt;= K &lt;= 12; 0 &lt;= H &lt;= 2).  All the numbers are separated by spaces.</p>
> <p>Then N lines follow, each contains M characters, which are either "." or "O", representing an open cell or an animal, respectively.  There will be at least 2 animals.
> </p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each case, print a single line containing a single integer: the number of solutions.</p>
> <b>Sample Input:</b><pre>
> 3 5 8 1
> ...O.
> .O...
> .....
> </pre>
> <b>Sample Output:</b><pre>
> 8
