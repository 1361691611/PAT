<h1>1020. Tree Traversals (25)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>Suppose that all the keys in a binary tree are distinct positive integers.  Given the postorder and inorder traversal sequences, you are supposed to output the level order traversal sequence of the corresponding binary tree.</p>
> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (&amp;lt=30), the total number of nodes in the binary tree.  The second line gives the postorder sequence and the third line gives the inorder sequence.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of the corresponding binary tree.  All the numbers in a line must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.</p>
> <b>Sample Input:</b><pre>
