<h1>1127. ZigZagging on a Tree (30)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>Suppose that all the keys in a binary tree are distinct positive integers.  A unique binary tree can be determined by a given pair of postorder and inorder traversal sequences.  And it is a simple standard routine to print the numbers in level-order.  However, if you think the problem is too simple, then you are too naive.  This time you are supposed to print the numbers in "zigzagging order" -- that is, starting from the root, print the numbers level-by-level, alternating between left to right and right to left.  For example, for the following tree you must output: 1 11 5 8 17 12 20 15.</p>

> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (&lt;= 30), the total number of nodes in the binary tree.  The second line gives the inorder sequence and the third line gives the postorder sequence.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each test case, print the zigzagging sequence of the tree in a line.  All the numbers in a line must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.</p>
> <b>Sample Input:</b><pre>
> 8
> 12 11 20 17 1 15 8 5
> 12 20 17 11 15 8 5 1
> </pre>
> <b>Sample Output:</b><pre>
> 1 11 5 8 17 12 20 15
