<h1>1128. N Queens Puzzle (20)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>The "eight queens puzzle" is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general N queens problem of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. (From Wikipedia - "Eight queens puzzle".)</p>
> <p>Here you are NOT asked to solve the puzzles. Instead, you are supposed to judge whether or not a given configuration of the chessboard is a solution.  To simplify the representation of a chessboard, let us assume that no two queens will be placed in the same column.  Then a configuration can be represented by a simple integer sequence (Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>2</sub>, ..., Q<sub>N</sub>), where Q<sub>i</sub> is the row number of the queen in the i-th column.  For example, Figure 1 can be represented by (4, 6, 8, 2, 7, 1, 3, 5) and it is indeed a solution to the 8 queens puzzle; while Figure 2 can be represented by (4, 6, 7, 2, 8, 1, 9, 5, 3) and is NOT a 9 queens' solution.</p>

> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains several test cases. The first line gives an integer K (1 &lt; K &lt;= 200).  Then K lines follow, each gives a configuration in the format "N Q<sub>1</sub> Q<sub>2</sub> ... Q<sub>N</sub>", where 4 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000 and it is guaranteed that 1 &lt;= Q<sub>i</sub> &lt;= N for all i=1, ..., N.  The numbers are separated by spaces.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each configuration, if it is a solution to the N queens problem, print "YES" in a line; or "NO" if not.
