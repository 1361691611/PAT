<h1>1102. Invert a Binary Tree (25)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>The following is from Max Howell @twitter:</p>
> <p><i>Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can't invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.</i></p>
> <p>Now it's your turn to prove that YOU CAN invert a binary tree!</p>
> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (&lt;=10) which is the total number of nodes in the tree -- and hence the nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1. Then N lines follow, each corresponds to a node from 0 to N-1, and gives the indices of the left and right children of the node. If the child does not exist, a "-" will be put at the position. Any pair of children are separated by a space.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each test case, print in the first line the level-order, and then in the second line the in-order traversal sequences of the inverted tree. There must be exactly one space between any adjacent numbers, and no extra space at the end of the line.</p>
