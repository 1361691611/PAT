<h1>1104. Sum of Number Segments (20)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>
> Given a sequence of positive numbers, a <i>segment</i> is defined to be a consecutive subsequence.  For example, given the sequence {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}, we have 10 segments: (0.1) (0.1, 0.2) (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) (0.2) (0.2, 0.3) (0.2, 0.3, 0.4) (0.3) (0.3, 0.4) (0.4).
> </p>
> <p>Now given a sequence, you are supposed to find the sum of all the numbers in all the segments.  For the previous example, the sum of all the 10 segments is 0.1 + 0.3 + 0.6 + 1.0 + 0.2 + 0.5 + 0.9 + 0.3 + 0.7 + 0.4 = 5.0.

> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N, the size of the sequence which is no more than 10<sup>5</sup>.  The next line contains N positive numbers in the sequence, each no more than 1.0, separated by a space.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each test case, print in one line the sum of all the numbers in all the segments, accurate up to 2 decimal places.</p>
