<h1>1134. Vertex Cover (25)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>A <b>vertex cover</b> of a graph is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex of the set.  Now given a graph with several vertex sets, you are supposed to tell if each of them is a vertex cover or not.
> </p>
> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives two positive integers N and M (both no more than 10<sup>4</sup>), being the total numbers of vertices and the edges, respectively.  Then M lines follow, each describes an edge by giving the indices (from 0 to N-1) of the two ends of the edge.
> </p>
> <p>After the graph, a positive integer K (&lt;= 100) is given, which is the number of queries.  Then K lines of queries follow, each in the format:</p>
> <p>
> Nv v[1] v[2] ... v[Nv]
> </p>
> <p>
> where <b>Nv</b> is the number of vertices in the set, and <b>v[i]</b>'s are the indices of the vertices.
> </p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each query, print in a line "Yes" if the set is a vertex cover, or "No" if not.
> </p>
