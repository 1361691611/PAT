<h1>1132. Cut Integer (20)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>Cutting an integer means to cut a K digits long integer Z into two integers of (K/2) digits long integers A and B.  For example, after cutting Z = 167334, we have A = 167 and B = 334.  It is interesting to see that Z can be devided by the product of A and B, as 167334 / (167 x 334) = 3.  Given an integer Z, you are supposed to test if it is such an integer.

> Input Specification:

> <p>For each case, print a single line "Yes" if it is such a number, or "No" if not.</p>
