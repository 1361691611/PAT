<h1>1088. Rational Arithmetic (20)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>For two rational numbers, your task is to implement the basic arithmetics, that is, to calculate their sum, difference, product and quotient.</p>
> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case, which gives in one line the two rational numbers in the format "a1/b1 a2/b2".  The numerators and the denominators are all in the range of <i>long int</i>.  If there is a negative sign, it must appear only in front of the numerator.  The denominators are guaranteed to be non-zero numbers.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each test case, print in 4 lines the sum, difference, product and quotient of the two rational numbers, respectively.  The format of each line is "number1 operator number2 = result".  Notice that all the rational numbers must be in their simplest form "k a/b", where <b>k</b> is the integer part, and <b>a/b</b> is the simplest fraction part.  If the number is negative, it must be included in a pair of parentheses.  If the denominator in the division is zero, output "Inf" as the result.  It is guaranteed that all the output integers are in the range of <i>long int</i>.</p>
> <b>Sample Input 1:</b><pre>
> 2/3 -4/2
> </pre>
> <b>Sample Output 1:</b><pre>
> 2/3 + (-2) = (-1 1/3)
> 2/3 - (-2) = 2 2/3
> 2/3 * (-2) = (-1 1/3)
> 2/3 / (-2) = (-1/3)
> </pre>
> <b>Sample Input 2:</b><pre>
> 5/3 0/6
> </pre>
> <b>Sample Output 2:</b><pre>
> 1 2/3 + 0 = 1 2/3
> 1 2/3 - 0 = 1 2/3
> 1 2/3 * 0 = 0
> 1 2/3 / 0 = Inf
