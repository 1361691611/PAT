<h1>1004. Counting Leaves (30)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
>   A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree.  Your job is to count those family members who have no child.<p>
> </p><p><b>Input</b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 0 &amp;lt N &amp;lt 100, the number of nodes in a tree, and M (&amp;lt N), the number of non-leaf nodes.  Then M lines follow, each in the format:</p>
> <pre>
> ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]
> </pre>
> where ID is a two-digit number representing a given non-leaf node, K is the number of its children, followed by a sequence of two-digit ID's of its children.  For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be 01.
> 
> <p><b>Output</b></p>
> <p>For each test case, you are supposed to count those family members who have no child <b>for every seniority level</b> starting from the root.  The numbers must be printed in a line, separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of each line.</p>
> <p>The sample case represents a tree with only 2 nodes, where 01 is the root and 02 is its only child.  Hence on the root 01 level, there is 0 leaf node; and on the next level, there is 1 leaf node.  Then we should output "0 1" in a line.</p>
> <b>Sample Input</b><pre>
> 2 1
> 01 1 02
> </pre>
> <b>Sample Output</b><pre>
> 0 1
