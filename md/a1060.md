<h1>1060. Are They Equal (25)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>If a machine can save only 3 significant digits, the float numbers 12300 and 12358.9 are considered equal since they are both saved as 0.123*10<sup>5</sup> with simple chopping.  Now given the number of significant digits on a machine and two float numbers, you are supposed to tell if they are treated equal in that machine.

> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case which gives three numbers N, A and B, where N (&lt;100) is the number of significant digits, and A and B are the two float numbers to be compared.  Each float number is non-negative, no greater than 10<sup>100</sup>, and that its total digit number is less than 100.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each test case, print in a line "YES" if the two numbers are treated equal, and then the number in the standard form "0.d<sub>1</sub>...d<sub>N</sub>*10^k" (d<sub>1</sub>&gt;0 unless the number is 0); or "NO" if they are not treated equal, and then the two numbers in their standard form.  All the terms must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of a line.</p>
> <p>Note: Simple chopping is assumed without rounding.</p>
