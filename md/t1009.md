<h1>1009. Triple Inversions (35)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>Given a list of N integers A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>,...A<sub>N</sub>, there's a famous problem to count the number of inversions in it.  An inversion is defined as a pair of indices i &lt; j such that A<sub>i</sub> &gt; A<sub>j</sub>.</p>
> <p>Now we have a new challenging problem. You are supposed to count the number of <b>triple inversions</b> in it.  As you may guess, a triple inversion is defined as a triple of indices i &lt; j &lt; k such that A<sub>i</sub> &gt; A<sub>j</sub> &gt; A<sub>k</sub>. For example, in the list {5, 1, 4, 3, 2} there are 4 triple inversions, namely (5,4,3), (5,4,2), (5,3,2) and (4,3,2).  To simplify the problem, the list A is given as a permutation of integers from 1 to N.</p>

> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N in [3, 10<sup>5</sup>].  The second line contains a permutation of integers from 1 to N and each of the integer is separated by a single space.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each case, print in a line the number of triple inversions in the list.</p>
