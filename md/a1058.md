<h1>1058. A+B in Hogwarts (20)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you would know the world of magic has its own currency system -- as Hagrid explained it to Harry, "Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough."  Your job is to write a program to compute A+B where A and B are given in the standard form of "Galleon.Sickle.Knut" (Galleon is an integer in [0, 10<sup>7</sup>], Sickle is an integer in [0, 17), and Knut is an integer in [0, 29)).</p>
> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line with A and B in the standard form, separated by one space. 
> </p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each test case you should output the sum of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input.</p>
