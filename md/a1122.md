<h1>1122. Hamiltonian Cycle (25)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>The "Hamilton cycle problem" is to find a simple cycle that contains every vertex in a graph.  Such a cycle is called a "Hamiltonian cycle".
> </p>
> <p>In this problem, you are supposed to tell if a given cycle is a Hamiltonian cycle.
> </p>
> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line contains 2 positive integers N (2&lt; N &lt;= 200), the number of vertices, and M, the number of edges in an undirected graph.  Then M lines follow, each describes an edge in the format "Vertex1 Vertex2", where the vertices are numbered from 1 to N.  The next line gives a positive integer K which is the number of queries, followed by K lines of queries, each in the format:</p>
> <p>
> n V<sub>1</sub> V<sub>2</sub> ... V<sub>n</sub>
> </p>
> <p>
> where n is the number of vertices in the list, and V<sub>i</sub>'s are the vertices on a path.
> </p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each query, print in a line "YES" if the path does form a Hamiltonian cycle, or "NO" if not.
