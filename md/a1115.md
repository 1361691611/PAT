<h1>1115. Counting Nodes in a BST (30)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:</p>
> <ul>
> <li>The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key. 
> </li><li>The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. 
> </li><li>Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. </li></ul>
> <p>Insert a sequence of numbers into an initially empty binary search tree.  Then you are supposed to count the total number of nodes in the lowest 2 levels of the resulting tree.</p>
> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (&lt;=1000) which is the size of the input sequence.  Then given in the next line are the N integers in [-1000 1000] which are supposed to be inserted into an initially empty binary search tree.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each case, print in one line the numbers of nodes in the lowest 2 levels of the resulting tree in the format:</p>
> <p>
> n1 + n2 = n
> </p>
> <p>
> where n1 is the number of nodes in the lowest level, n2 is that of the level above, and n is the sum.
> </p>
> <b>Sample Input:</b><pre>
> 9
> 25 30 42 16 20 20 35 -5 28
> </pre>
> <b>Sample Output:</b><pre>
> 2 + 4 = 6
> </pre>
