<h1>1099. Build A Binary Search Tree (30)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:</p>
> <li>The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
> </li><li>The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
> </li><li>Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. 
> 
> <p>Given the structure of a binary tree and a sequence of distinct integer keys, there is only one way to fill these keys into the tree so that the resulting tree satisfies the definition of a BST.  You are supposed to output the level order traversal sequence of that tree.  The sample is illustrated by Figure 1 and 2.

> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (&lt;=100) which is the total number of nodes in the tree.  The next N lines each contains the left and the right children of a node in the format "left_index right_index", provided that the nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1, and 0 is always the root.  If one child is missing, then -1 will represent the NULL child pointer.  Finally N distinct integer keys are given in the last line.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of that tree.  All the numbers must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of the line.

> <b>Sample Input:</b><pre>
> 9
> 1 6
> 2 3
> -1 -1
> -1 4

> 7 -1
> -1 8
> -1 -1
> 73 45 11 58 82 25 67 38 42
