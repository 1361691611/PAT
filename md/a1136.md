<h1>1136. A Delayed Palindrome (20)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>Consider a positive integer N written in standard notation with k+1 digits a<sub>i</sub> as a<sub>k</sub>...a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>0</sub> with 0 &lt;= a<sub>i</sub> &lt; 10 for all i and a<sub>k</sub> &gt; 0. Then N is <b>palindromic</b> if and only if a<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>k-i</sub> for all i. Zero is written 0 and is also palindromic by definition.

> Non-palindromic numbers can be paired with palindromic ones via a series of operations. First, the non-palindromic number is reversed and the result is added to the original number. If the result is not a palindromic number, this is repeated until it gives a palindromic number. Such number is called <b>a delayed palindrome</b>. (Quoted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number)

> <p>
> Given any positive integer, you are supposed to find its paired palindromic number.
> </p>
> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case which gives a positive integer no more than 1000 digits.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each test case, print line by line the process of finding the palindromic number.  The format of each line is the following:</p><pre>
> A + B = C
> </pre>
> <p>
> where A is the original number, B is the reversed A, and C is their sum.  A starts being the input number, and this process ends until C becomes a palindromic number -- in this case we print in the last line "C is a palindromic number."; or if a palindromic number cannot be found in 10 iterations, print "Not found in 10 iterations." instead.

> 10755470 + 07455701 = 18211171
