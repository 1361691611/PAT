## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>Notice that the number 123456789 is a 9-digit number consisting exactly the numbers from 1 to 9, with no duplication.  Double it we will obtain 246913578, which happens to be another 9-digit number consisting exactly the numbers from 1 to 9, only in a different permutation.  Check to see the result if we double it again!
> </p>
> <p>Now you are suppose to check if there are more numbers with this property.  That is, double a given number with k digits, you are to tell if the resulting number consists of only a permutation of the digits in the original number.</p>
> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case.  Each case contains one positive integer with no more than 20 digits.</p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each test case, first print in a line "Yes" if doubling the input number gives a number that consists of only a permutation of the digits in the original number, or "No" if not.  Then in the next line, print the doubled number.</p>
