<h1>1007. Maximum Subsequence Sum (25)</h1>

## 题目

> <div id="problemContent">
> <p>Given a sequence of K integers { N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, ..., N<sub>K</sub> }.  A continuous subsequence is defined to be { N<sub>i</sub>, N<sub>i+1</sub>, ..., N<sub>j</sub> } where 1 &lt;= i &lt;= j &lt;= K.  The <i>Maximum Subsequence</i> is the continuous subsequence which has the largest sum of its elements.  For example, given sequence { -2, 11, -4, 13, -5, -2 }, its maximum subsequence is { 11, -4, 13 } with the largest sum being 20.</p>
> <p>Now you are supposed to find the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum subsequence.
> </p>
> <p><b>
> Input Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies two lines.  The first line contains a positive integer K (&lt;= 10000).  The second line contains K numbers, separated by a space.
> </p>
> <p><b>
> Output Specification:
> </b></p>
> <p>For each test case, output in one line the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum subsequence. The numbers must be separated by one space, but there must be no extra space at the end of a line.  In case that the maximum subsequence is not unique, output the one with the smallest indices i and j (as shown by the sample case).  If all the K numbers are negative, then its maximum sum is defined to be 0, and you are supposed to output the first and the last numbers of the whole sequence.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int K, n, first;
    int start, end, sum = -1;   /* the current non-negative subsequence */
    int a = -1, b, s = 0;       /* the maximum-sum subsequence */
    
    scanf("%d", &K);
    for(int i = 0; i < K; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &n);
        if(i == 0) first = n;               /* record the first number */
        
        /* update start, end and sum for the current non-negative subsequence */
        if(sum < 0) start = n, sum = 0;     /* reset if sum < 0 */
        sum += n;                           /* update sum */
        if(sum >= 0) end = n;               /* update end if sum >= 0 */
        
        /* update a, b and s for the so-far maximum-sum subsequence */
        if(sum > s || (!sum && !s))         /* special case is max-sum is 0 */
            a = start, b = end, s = sum;
    }
    /* a won't be updated if all the numbers are negative */
    if(a == -1) printf("0 %d %d", first, n);    
    else        printf("%d %d %d", s, a, b);
    
    return 0;
