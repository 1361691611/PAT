<h1>1054. The Dominant Color (20)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>Behind the scenes in the computer's memory, color is always talked about as a series of 24 bits of information for each pixel.  In an image, the color with the largest proportional area is called the dominant color.  A <i>strictly</i> dominant color takes more than half of the total area.  Now given an image of resolution M by N (for example, 800x600), you are supposed to point out the strictly dominant color.</p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line contains 2 positive numbers: M (&lt;=800) and N (&lt;=600) which are the resolutions of the image.  Then N lines follow, each contains M digital colors in the range [0, 2<sup>24</sup>).  It is guaranteed that the strictly dominant color exists for each input image.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each test case, simply print the dominant color in a line.</p>
