<h1>1031. Hello World for U (20)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>Given any string of N (&gt;=5) characters, you are asked to form the characters into the shape of U.  For example, "helloworld" can be printed as:<pre>
h  d
e  l
l  r
lowo
</pre>

That is, the characters must be printed in the original order, starting top-down from the left vertical line with n<sub>1</sub> characters, then left to right along the bottom line with n<sub>2</sub> characters, and finally bottom-up along the vertical line with n<sub>3</sub> characters.  And more, we would like U to be as squared as possible -- that is, it must be satisfied that n<sub>1</sub> = n<sub>3</sub> = max { k| k &lt;= n<sub>2</sub> for all 3 &lt;= n<sub>2</sub> &lt;= N } with n<sub>1</sub> + n<sub>2</sub> + n<sub>3</sub> - 2 = N.</p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  Each case contains one string with no less than 5 and no more than 80 characters in a line.  The string contains no white space.</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each test case, print the input string in the shape of U as specified in the description.</p>
<b>Sample Input:</b><pre>
helloworld!
</pre>
<b>Sample Output:</b><pre>
h   !
e   d
l   l
