<h1>1014. Circles of Friends (35)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>A circle of friends is a network of friend relationships.  If A is a friend of B, then B is considered a friend of A no matter B admits or not, and they are said to belong to the same circle.  Here we assume that friendship is transitive, that is, if A is a friend of B, and B is a friend of C, then A is a friend of C and the three of them all belong to the same circle.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, A is not so close to C as B is.  We define the distance D(X, Y) between two friends X and Y as the minimum number of friends between them.  For example, D(A, B) = 0, and D(C, A) = 1.  The diameter of a friends circle is the maximum distance between any pair of friends in the circle.
</p>
<p>
Now given some people's relationships, you are supposed to find the number of friends circles and the circle with the largest diameter.

Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives an integer N (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000), which is the total number of people involved, and hence they are numbered from 1 to N.  Then N lines follow, each in the format:</p>
<p>
k p<sub>1</sub> ... p<sub>k</sub>
</p>
<p>
where k (0 &lt;= k &lt; min(10, N)) is the number of friends and p<sub>1</sub> to p<sub>k</sub> (if k&gt;0) are the friends' indices.  The i-th line corresponds to the i-th person.  All the numbers in a line are separated by spaces.  It is guaranteed that no one is given as a friend of oneself.
</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each case, print in a line the number of friends circles, and the largest diameter, separated by exactly one space.
