<p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each test case, the first line contains a positive integer N (&lt;=1000), the total number of people in a social network.  Hence the people are numbered from 1 to N.  Then N lines follow, each gives the hobby list of a person in the format:</p>
<p>
K<sub>i</sub>: h<sub>i</sub>[1] h<sub>i</sub>[2] ... h<sub>i</sub>[K<sub>i</sub>]</p>
<p>where K<sub>i</sub> (&gt;0) is the number of hobbies, and h<sub>i</sub>[j] is the index of the j-th hobby, which is an integer in [1, 1000].</p>
