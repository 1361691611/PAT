Rational Arithmetic
<div class="ques-view"><p>For two rational numbers, your task is to implement the basic arithmetics, that is, to calculate their sum, difference, product and quotient.</p>
<h3 id="input-specification-">Input Specification:</h3>
<p>Each input file contains one test case, which gives in one line the two rational numbers in the format <code>a1/b1 a2/b2</code>. The numerators and the denominators are all in the range of long int. If there is a negative sign, it must appear only in front of the numerator. The denominators are guaranteed to be non-zero numbers.</p>
<h3 id="output-specification-">Output Specification:</h3>
<p>For each test case, print in 4 lines the sum, difference, product and quotient of the two rational numbers, respectively. The format of each line is <code>number1 operator number2 = result</code>. Notice that all the rational numbers must be in their simplest form <code>k a/b</code>, where <code>k</code> is the integer part, and <code>a/b</code> is the simplest fraction part. If the number is negative, it must be included in a pair of parentheses. If the denominator in the division is zero, output <code>Inf</code> as the result. It is guaranteed that all the output integers are in the range of <strong>long int</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="sample-input-1-">Sample Input 1:</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-in">2/3 -4/2

<h3 id="sample-output-1-">Sample Output 1:</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-out">2/3 + (-2) = (-1 1/3)
2/3 - (-2) = 2 2/3
2/3 * (-2) = (-1 1/3)
2/3 / (-2) = (-1/3)

<pre><code class="lang-in">5/3 0/6
</code></pre>
<h3 id="sample-output-2-">Sample Output 2:</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-out">1 2/3 + 0 = 1 2/3
1 2/3 - 0 = 1 2/3
1 2/3 * 0 = 0
1 2/3 / 0 = Inf
