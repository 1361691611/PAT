<h1>1140. Look-and-say Sequence (20)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p><b>Look-and-say sequence</b> is a sequence of integers as the following:
</p><pre>
D, D1, D111, D113, D11231, D112213111, ...
</pre><p>
where D is in [0, 9] except 1. The (n+1)st number is a kind of description of the nth number. For example, the 2nd number means that there is one D in the 1st number, and hence it is D1; the 2nd number consists of one D (corresponding to D1) and one 1 (corresponding to 11), therefore the 3rd number is D111; or since the 4th number is D113, it consists of one D, two 1's, and one 3, so the next number must be D11231. This definition works for D = 1 as well. Now you are supposed to calculate the Nth number in a look-and-say sequence of a given digit D.

Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case, which gives D (in [0, 9]) and a positive integer N (&lt;=40), separated by a space.

<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Print in a line the Nth number in a look-and-say sequence of D.
