<h1>1041. Be Unique (20)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>Being unique is so important to people on Mars that even their lottery is designed in a unique way.  The rule of winning is simple: one bets on a number chosen from [1, 10<sup>4</sup>].  The first one who bets on a unique number wins.  For example, if there are 7 people betting on 5 31 5 88 67 88 17, then the second one who bets on 31 wins.</p>
