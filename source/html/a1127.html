ZigZagging on a Tree (30)
<div class="ques-view"><p>Suppose that all the keys in a binary tree are distinct positive integers.  A unique binary tree can be determined by a given pair of postorder and inorder traversal sequences.  And it is a simple standard routine to print the numbers in level-order.  However, if you think the problem is too simple, then you are too naive.  This time you are supposed to print the numbers in "zigzagging order" -- that is, starting from the root, print the numbers level-by-level, alternating between left to right and right to left.  For example, for the following tree you must output: 1 11 5 8 17 12 20 15.</p>

<h3 id="input-specification-">Input Specification:</h3>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><mrow><mo>≤</mo></mrow>\le</math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.63597em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.7719400000000001em;vertical-align:-0.13597em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mrel">≤</span></span></span></span>30), the total number of nodes in the binary tree.  The second line gives the inorder sequence and the third line gives the postorder sequence.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.</p>
<h3 id="output-specification-">Output Specification:</h3>
<p>For each test case, print the zigzagging sequence of the tree in a line.  All the numbers in a line must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.</p>
