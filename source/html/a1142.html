<h1>1142. Maximal Clique (25)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>A <b>clique</b> is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent.  A <b>maximal clique</b> is a clique that cannot be extended by including one more adjacent vertex.  (Quoted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory))
</p>
<p>
Now it is your job to judge if a given subset of vertices can form a maximal clique.
</p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives two positive integers Nv (&lt;= 200), the number of vertices in the graph, and Ne, the number of undirected edges.  Then Ne lines follow, each gives a pair of vertices of an edge.  The vertices are numbered from 1 to Nv.  </p>
<p>After the graph, there is another positive integer M (&lt;= 100).  Then M lines of query follow, each first gives a positive number K (&lt;= Nv), then followed by a sequence of K distinct vertices.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.
</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each of the M queries, print in a line "Yes" if the given subset of vertices can form a maximal clique; or if it is a clique but not a <b>maximal clique</b>, print "Not Maximal"; or if it is not a clique at all, print "Not a Clique".</p>
