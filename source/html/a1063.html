<h1>1063. Set Similarity (25)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>Given two sets of integers, the similarity of the sets is defined to be N<sub>c</sub>/N<sub>t</sub>*100%, where N<sub>c</sub> is the number of distinct common numbers shared by the two sets, and N<sub>t</sub> is the total number of distinct numbers in the two sets.  Your job is to calculate the similarity of any given pair of sets.</p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  Each case first gives a positive integer N (&lt;=50) which is the total number of sets.  Then N lines follow, each gives a set with a positive M (&lt;=10<sup>4</sup>) and followed by M integers in the range [0, 10<sup>9</sup>].  After the input of sets, a positive integer K (&lt;=2000) is given, followed by K lines of queries.  Each query gives a pair of set numbers (the sets are numbered from 1 to N).  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each query, print in one line the similarity of the sets, in the percentage form accurate up to 1 decimal place.</p>
