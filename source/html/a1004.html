<h1>1004. Counting Leaves (30)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
  A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree.  Your job is to count those family members who have no child.<p>
<p><b>Input</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 0 &lt; N &lt; 100, the number of nodes in a tree, and M (&lt; N), the number of non-leaf nodes.  Then M lines follow, each in the format:</p>
<pre>
ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]
</pre>
where ID is a two-digit number representing a given non-leaf node, K is the number of its children, followed by a sequence of two-digit ID's of its children.  For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be 01.</p>
<p><b>Output</b></p>
<p>For each test case, you are supposed to count those family members who have no child <b>for every seniority level</b> starting from the root.  The numbers must be printed in a line, separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of each line.</p>
<p>The sample case represents a tree with only 2 nodes, where 01 is the root and 02 is its only child.  Hence on the root 01 level, there is 0 leaf node; and on the next level, there is 1 leaf node.  Then we should output "0 1" in a line.</p>
<b>Sample Input</b><pre>
2 1
01 1 02
</pre>
<b>Sample Output</b><pre>
0 1
</pre>
