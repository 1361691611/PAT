Raffle for Weibo Followers
<div class="ques-view"><p>John got a full mark on PAT. He was so happy that he decided to hold a raffle（抽奖） for his followers on Weibo -- that is, he would select winners from every N followers who forwarded his post, and give away gifts. Now you are supposed to help him generate the list of winners.</p>
<h3 id="input-specification-">Input Specification:</h3>
<p>Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives three positive integers M (<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><mrow><mo>≤</mo></mrow>\le</math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="strut" style="height:0.63597em;"></span><span class="strut bottom" style="height:0.7719400000000001em;vertical-align:-0.13597em;"></span><span class="base textstyle uncramped"><span class="mrel">≤</span></span></span></span> 1000), N and S, being the total number of forwards, the skip number of winners, and the index of the first winner (the indices start from 1). Then M lines follow, each gives the nickname (a nonempty string of no more than 20 characters, with no white space or return) of a follower who has forwarded John's post.</p>
<p>Note: it is possible that someone would forward more than once, but no one can win more than once. Hence if the current candidate of a winner has won before, we must skip him/her and consider the next one.</p>
<h3 id="output-specification-">Output Specification:</h3>
<p>For each case, print the list of winners in the same order as in the input, each nickname occupies a line. If there is no winner yet, print <code>Keep going...</code> instead.</p>
