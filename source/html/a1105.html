<h1>1105. Spiral Matrix (25)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>This time your job is to fill a sequence of N positive integers into a <b>spiral matrix</b> in non-increasing order.  A <b>spiral matrix</b> is filled in from the first element at the upper-left corner, then move in a clockwise spiral.  The matrix has <b>m</b> rows and <b>n</b> columns, where <b>m</b> and <b>n</b> satisfy the following: <b>m</b>*<b>n</b> must be equal to N; <b>m</b>&gt;=<b>n</b>; and <b>m</b>-<b>n</b> is the minimum of all the possible values.</p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N.  Then the next line contains N positive integers to be filled into the spiral matrix.  All the numbers are no more than 10<sup>4</sup>.  The numbers in a line are separated by spaces.</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each test case, output the resulting matrix in <b>m</b> lines, each contains <b>n</b> numbers.  There must be exactly 1 space between two adjacent numbers, and no extra space at the end of each line.
</p>
<b>Sample Input:</b><pre>
