<h1>1050. String Subtraction (20)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>Given two strings S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>, S = S<sub>1</sub> - S<sub>2</sub> is defined to be the remaining string after taking all the characters in S<sub>2</sub> from S<sub>1</sub>.  Your task is simply to calculate S<sub>1</sub> - S<sub>2</sub> for any given strings.  However, it might not be that simple to do it <i>fast</i>.</p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  Each case consists of two lines which gives S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>, respectively.  The string lengths of both strings are no more than 10<sup>4</sup>.  It is guaranteed that all the characters are visible ASCII codes and white space, and a new line character signals the end of a string.</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each test case, print S<sub>1</sub> - S<sub>2</sub> in one line.  </p>
<b>Sample Input:</b><pre>
