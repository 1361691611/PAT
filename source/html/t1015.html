<h1>1015. Letter-moving Game (35)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>Here is a simple intersting letter-moving game. The game starts with 2 strings S and T consist of lower case English letters. S and T contain the same letters but the orders might be different. In other words S can be obtained by shuffling letters in String T. At each step, you can move one arbitrary letter in S either to the beginning or to the end of it. How many steps at least to change S into T?
