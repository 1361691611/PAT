<h1>1012. The Best Rank (25)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>To evaluate the performance of our first year CS majored students, we consider their grades of three courses only: C - C Programming Language, M - Mathematics (Calculus or Linear Algebra), and E - English.  At the mean time, we encourage students by emphasizing on their best ranks -- that is, among the four ranks with respect to the three courses and the average grade, we print the best rank for each student.</p>
<p>For example, The grades of C, M, E and A - Average of 4 students are given as the following:</p>
<pre>
StudentID  C  M  E  A
310101     98 85 88 90
310102     70 95 88 84
310103     82 87 94 88
310104     91 91 91 91
</pre>
<p>Then the best ranks for all the students are <i>No.1</i> since the 1st one has done the best in C Programming Language, while the 2nd one in Mathematics, the 3rd one in English, and the last one in average.</p>
<p><b>Input</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  Each case starts with a line containing 2 numbers N and M (&lt;=2000), which are the total number of students, and the number of students who would check their ranks, respectively.  Then N lines follow, each contains a student ID which is a string of 6 digits, followed by the three integer grades (in the range of [0, 100]) of that student in the order of C, M and E.  Then there are M lines, each containing a student ID.</p>
<p><b>Output</b></p>
<p>For each of the M students, print in one line the best rank for him/her, and the symbol of the corresponding rank, separated by a space.</p>
<p>The priorities of the ranking methods are ordered as A &gt; C &gt; M &gt; E.  Hence if there are two or more ways for a student to obtain the same best rank, output the one with the highest priority.</p>
<p>If a student is not on the grading list, simply output "N/A".</p>
