<h1>1067. Sort with Swap(0,*) (25)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>Given any permutation of the numbers {0, 1, 2,..., N-1}, it is easy to sort them in increasing order.  But what if Swap(0, *) is the ONLY operation that is allowed to use?  For example, to sort {4, 0, 2, 1, 3} we may apply the swap operations in the following way:</p>
<p>
Swap(0, 1) =&gt; {4, 1, 2, 0, 3}<br/>
Swap(0, 3) =&gt; {4, 1, 2, 3, 0}<br/>
Swap(0, 4) =&gt; {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
</p>
<p>Now you are asked to find the minimum number of swaps need to sort the given permutation of the first N nonnegative integers. </p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case, which gives a positive N (&lt;=10<sup>5</sup>) followed by a permutation sequence of {0, 1, ..., N-1}.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each case, simply print in a line the minimum number of swaps need to sort the given permutation.</p>
<b>Sample Input:</b><pre>
10 3 5 7 2 6 4 9 0 8 1
</pre>
<b>Sample Output:</b><pre>
9
