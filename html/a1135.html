<h1>1135. Is It A Red-Black Tree (30)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>There is a kind of balanced binary search tree named <b>red-black tree</b> in the data structure. It has the following 5 properties:</p>
<p>
(1) Every node is either red or black.<br/>
(2) The root is black.<br/>
(3) Every leaf (NULL) is black.<br/>
(4) If a node is red, then both its children are black.<br/>
(5) For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.
</p>
<p>For example, the tree in Figure 1 is a red-black tree, while the ones in Figure 2 and 3 are not.</p>

<p>For each given binary search tree, you are supposed to tell if it is a legal red-black tree.</p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains several test cases.  The first line gives a positive integer K (&lt;=30) which is the total number of cases.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (&lt;=30), the total number of nodes in the binary tree.  The second line gives the preorder traversal sequence of the tree.  While all the keys in a tree are positive integers, we use negative signs to represent red nodes.  All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.  The sample input cases correspond to the trees shown in Figure 1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each test case, print in a line "Yes" if the given tree is a red-black tree, or "No" if not.</p>
