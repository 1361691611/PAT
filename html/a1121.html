<p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (&lt;=50000), the total number of couples.  Then N lines of the couples follow, each gives a couple of ID's which are 5-digit numbers (i.e. from 00000 to 99999).  After the list of couples, there is a positive integer M (&lt;=10000) followed by M ID's of the party guests.  The numbers are separated by spaces.
