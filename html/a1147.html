<h1>1147. Heaps (30)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>In computer science, a <b>heap</b> is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of C. A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a complete binary tree. (Quoted from Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure))
</p>
<p>
Your job is to tell if a given complete binary tree is a heap.
</p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives two positive integers: M (&lt;= 100), the number of trees to be tested; and N (1 &lt; N &lt;= 1000), the number of keys in each tree, respectively.  Then M lines follow, each contains N distinct integer keys (all in the range of <b>int</b>), which gives the level order traversal sequence of a complete binary tree.
</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each given tree, print in a line "Max Heap" if it is a max heap, or "Min Heap" for a min heap, or "Not Heap" if it is not a heap at all.  Then in the next line print the tree's postorder traversal sequence.  All the numbers are separated by a space, and there must no extra space at the beginning or the end of the line.</p>
