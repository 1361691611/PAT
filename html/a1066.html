<h1>1066. Root of AVL Tree (25)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree.  In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.  Figures 1-4 illustrate the rotation rules.</p>

<p>Now given a sequence of insertions, you are supposed to tell the root of the resulting AVL tree.</p>
