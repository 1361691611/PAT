<h1>1021. Deepest Root (25)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>A graph which is connected and acyclic can be considered a tree.  The height of the tree depends on the selected root.  Now you are supposed to find the root that results in a highest tree.  Such a root is called <i>the deepest root</i>.</p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line contains a positive integer N (&lt;=10000) which is the number of nodes, and hence the nodes are numbered from 1 to N.  Then N-1 lines follow, each describes an edge by given the two adjacent nodes' numbers.</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each test case, print each of the deepest roots in a line.  If such a root is not unique, print them in increasing order of their numbers.  In case that the given graph is not a tree, print "Error: K components" where K is the number of connected components in the graph.</p>
