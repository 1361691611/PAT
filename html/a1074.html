<h1>1074. Reversing Linked List (25)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>Given a constant K and a singly linked list L, you are supposed to reverse the links of every K elements on L.  For example, given L being 1→2→3→4→5→6, if K = 3, then you must output 3→2→1→6→5→4; if K = 4, you must output 4→3→2→1→5→6.</p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line contains the address of the first node, a positive N (&lt;= 10<sup>5</sup>) which is the total number of nodes, and a positive K (&lt;=N) which is the length of the sublist to be reversed.  The address of a node is a 5-digit nonnegative integer, and NULL is represented by -1.</p>
<p>Then N lines follow, each describes a node in the format:</p>
<p><i>Address Data Next</i></p>
<p>where <i>Address</i> is the position of the node, <i>Data</i> is an integer, and <i>Next</i> is the position of the next node.</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each case, output the resulting ordered linked list.  Each node occupies a line, and is printed in the same format as in the input.
