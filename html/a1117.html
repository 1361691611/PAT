<h1>1117. Eddington Number(25)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>British astronomer Eddington liked to ride a bike.  It is said that in order to show off his skill, he has even defined an "Eddington number", E -- that is, the maximum integer E such that it is for E days that one rides more than E miles.  Eddington's own E was 87.</p>
<p>
Now given everyday's distances that one rides for N days, you are supposed to find the corresponding E (&lt;=N).
</p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N(&lt;=10<sup>5</sup>), the days of continuous riding.  Then N non-negative integers are given in the next line, being the riding distances of everyday.</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each case, print in a line the Eddington number for these N days.
