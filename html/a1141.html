<h1>1141. PAT Ranking of Institutions (25)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>After each PAT, the PAT Center will announce the ranking of institutions based on their students' performances.  Now you are asked to generate the ranklist.
</p>
<p><b>
Input Specification:
</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (&lt;=10<sup>5</sup>), which is the number of testees.  Then N lines follow, each gives the information of a testee in the following format:</p>
<p>
ID Score School
</p>
<p>
where "ID" is a string of 6 characters with the first one representing the test level: "B" stands for the basic level, "A" the advanced level and "T" the top level;  "Score" is an integer in [0, 100]; and "School" is the institution code which is a string of no more than 6 English letters (case insensitive).  Note: it is guaranteed that "ID" is unique for each testee.
</p>
<p><b>
Output Specification:
</b></p>
<p>For each case, first print in a line the total number of institutions.  Then output the ranklist of institutions in nondecreasing order of their ranks in the following format:</p>
<p>
Rank School TWS Ns
</p>
<p>
where "Rank" is the rank (start from 1) of the institution; "School" is the institution code (all in lower case);  "TWS" is the <b>total weighted score</b> which is defined to be the integer part of "Score<sub>B</sub>/1.5 + Score<sub>A</sub> + Score<sub>T</sub>*1.5", where "Score<sub>X</sub>" is the total score of the testees belong to this institution on level X; and "Ns" is the total number of testees who belong to this institution.
</p>
<p>
The institutions are ranked according to their TWS.  If there is a tie, the institutions are supposed to have the same rank, and they shall be printed in ascending order of Ns.  If there is still a tie, they shall be printed in alphabetical order of their codes.
