<h1>1028. List Sorting (25)</h1>
<div id="problemContent">
<p>Excel can sort records according to any column.  Now you are supposed to imitate this function.</p>
<p><b>Input</b></p>
<p>Each input file contains one test case.  For each case, the first line contains two integers N (&lt;=100000) and C, where N is the number of records and C is the column that you are supposed to sort the records with.  Then N lines follow, each contains a record of a student.  A student's record consists of his or her distinct ID (a 6-digit number), name (a string with no more than 8 characters without space), and grade (an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive).</p>
<p><b>Output</b></p>
<p>For each test case, output the sorting result in N lines.  That is, if C = 1 then the records must be sorted in increasing order according to ID's; if C = 2 then the records must be sorted in non-decreasing order according to names; and if C = 3 then the records must be sorted in non-decreasing order according to grades.  If there are several students who have the same name or grade, they must be sorted according to their ID's in increasing order.</p>
